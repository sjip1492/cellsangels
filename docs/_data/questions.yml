  - question: How is EGFR best defined? (Select best answer)
    answers:
      - answer: EGFR is a type of gene that provides instructions to produce a receptor protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor. This process occurs across the cell membrane resulting in part of the protein remaining inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell.
        correct: Y
      - answer: EGFR is a type of gene that provides instructions for the mitochondria to secrete a toxic protein called epidermal growth factor receptor.
        correct: N
      - answer: EGFR is a type of gene found only within individuals with gigantism due to overproduction of a receptor protein called epidermal growth factor receptor.  
        correct: N
  - question: EGFR is a type of gene that can become dangerous in regards to health if overexpressed within a body
