The epidermal growth factor receptor is a protein that aids in the transport across the cell membrane. The initial process occurs by binding to a group of proteins known as the epidermal growth factors. This receptor aids in the functioning of cellular growth, differentiation, and replication. The overexpression and underexpression of the egfr gene constitute a matter of medical research interest. Specifically, genetic mutations causing overexpression of EGFR have been linked to the development of cancer. Around 30% of epithelial cancers, meaning cancers relating to cells that compose the surface tissues of the skin, throat, internal organs, etc, are caused from a mutation in the EGFR.
