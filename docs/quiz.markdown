title: Test your knowledge!
---

Congratulations! You have officially completed the information seminar brought to you by BIOL112’s Cell’s Angels! This web page was specifically designed for folks like you who may be curious about the relationship between cellular activity and its effects on human health. 

The ultimate learning objective was for one to be able to describe the complexity and interrelationship between cellular components, specifically related to the EGFR gene.

With your new-found expanded knowledge, it's time to put you to the test!

Question 1) What functions can the EGFR contribute to in humans? (Select all that apply)
Tissue Development 
Enhance fertility 
Create change in taste-buds 
Cell signaling 

Question 2) Where is the EGFR gene found? (Select best answer)
Chromosome 4
Chromosome 5
Chromosome 6 
Chromosome 7

Question 3) What diseases can be associated with significant levels of EGFR? (Select all that apply)
Psoriasis
Cancer
Inflammation
Alzheimers
Heart Disease

Question 4) What treatments can be performed within humans with significant levels of EGFR? (Select all that apply)
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Intravenous (IV)
Comprehensive Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
Hydrogen Breath Test (HBT)

Question 5) How is EGFR best defined? (Select best answer)
EGFR is a type of gene that provides instructions to produce a receptor protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor. This process occurs across the cell membrane resulting in part of the protein remaining inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell.
EGFR is a type of gene that provides instructions for the mitochondria to secrete a toxic protein called epidermal growth factor receptor.
EGFR is a type of gene found only within individuals with gigantism due to overproduction of a receptor protein called epidermal growth factor receptor.  

Question 6) True or False: EGFR is a type of gene that can become dangerous in regards to health if overexpressed within a body
True
False

Question 7) What does PCR stand for in relation to screening? (Select best answer)
Pre-Cancer Respiration
Phenotype Cursory Response 
Polymerase Chain Reaction
Polysaccharide Case Report 
Polymerase Catalytic Reaction

Question 8) True or False: Any Individual can develop overexpression of the EGFR Gene? 
True
False 

Question 9) True or False: Any Individual can develop overexpression of the EGFR Gene? 
True
False 

Question 10) What portion of information within the Cell’s Angels information was most helpful to you in regards to better understanding the EGFR Gene? (All answers are correct, select best answer)
Key Terms
Background
Explanatory Videos
Mechanisms of Testing
Inheritability and Precautions
Common Symptoms
