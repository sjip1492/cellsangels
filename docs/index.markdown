Welcome to Cell's Angels' final project for BIOL 112: Biology of the Cell. 

We opted to write a literature review using our newfound knowledge of cell biology to synthesize pertinent information for a general audience. We also aimed to present this information in a novel way using Github Pages to host our website.

In-text citations are provided where applicable. For full citations see [here](\cellsangels\sources).

Don't forget to [test your knowledge](\cellsangels\quiz) at the end!


Thank you for reading!
