The epidermal growth factor receptor is a protein that aids in the transport across the cell membrane. The initial process occurs by binding to a group of proteins known as the epidermal growth factors. 

This receptor aids in the functioning of cellular growth, differentiation, and replication ([source 3](https://doi.org/10.1038/cgt.2014.55)).

The overexpression and underexpression of the egfr gene constitute a matter of medical research interest. Specifically, genetic mutations causing overexpression of EGFR have been linked to the development of cancer ([source 2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.11.041)). Around 30% of epithelial cancers, meaning cancers relating to cells that compose the surface tissues of the skin, throat, internal organs, etc, are caused from a mutation in the EGFR ([source 1](https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0626)).

Below is an image of the EGFR signaling pathway. The signaling pathway is the mechanism of how a gene controls the overall function in cell.

The EGFR gene humans is located on chromosome 7.
Below is a diagram of the EGFR gene's chromosome location.
