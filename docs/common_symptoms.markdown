EGFR family members have been discovered to be involved in a wide range of human diseases from psoriasis, cancer, inflammation, heart diseases and Alzheimerâ€™s disease [source 8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-008-7440-8). Almost all the carcinomas express significant levels of EGFR. These receptors are related to the maintenance of the transformed state in these carncinomas. EGFR is remarkably over expressed in glioblastoma and as for a large number of these cancers, EGFR is truncated and consequentialy activated. Notably, at present, major clinical trials have been directed against blocking EGFR and erbB2 signaling in tumors.
