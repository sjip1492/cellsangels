Welcome to our final project for Biology of the Cell. 
For our project, we have opted to do a literature review with the aim to uuse our knowledge of cell biology to synthesize information pertinent to a general audience. 
We hope to present this information in a novel way using Github Pages to host our website.

Thank you for reading!
