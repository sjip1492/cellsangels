The EGFR protein is visualized below using [PDB information](/cellsangels/assets/info/BU_3NJP.pdb) exported as an .obj file in Meshlab. We obtained the PDB file from [here](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/uniprot/P00533). PDB files are from the Protein Data Bank archive, and contain information about the 3D shapes of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. This information was obtained using the cryo-EM technique. For more information, see [PDB-101](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/introduction). 

The model is composed of the moleules listed in the PDB file. To view the information in JSON format click [here](/cellsangels/assets/info/BU_3NJP.json).

Once the model has loaded, try moving the mouse around the page to rotate the protein.
