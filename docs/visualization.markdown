The EGFR protein is visualized below using [PDB information](/assets/info/BU_3NJP.pdb) exported as an .obj file in Meshlab. We obtained the PDB file from [here](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4i23). PDB files are from the Protein Data Bank archive, and contain information about the 3D shapes of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. For more information, see [PDB-101](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/introduction).
